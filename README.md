Welcome to my personal website!

I'm Frederik Willemsen, a computer science student at the Technical University of Munich.

My main interests are in machine learning, molecular dynamcics simulations and efficient high performance computing.

The purpose of this website is that you can get a oversight over my interests and projects I have done so far, and what I am up to in the future. 
I am trying to keep this website updated as much as possible.

If you have any questions, please contact me at frederik.willemsen@tum.de.
